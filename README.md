# 🌍 Tableau Global Health Analysis Dashboard

This project presents a **data visualization dashboard** built with Tableau, analyzing global health trends across countries and regions using Gapminder health data.

It focuses on the relationships between **life expectancy**, **child mortality**, **income per person**, and **population** over time — helping uncover patterns of global development, inequality, and health outcomes.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

Data source: `GapminderHealth.xlsx`

Key indicators include:
- 🌱 Life Expectancy
- 🧒 Child Mortality
- 💰 Income per Person (GDP per capita)
- 🌐 Region
- 🧍 Population
- 📅 Year (longitudinal data)

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Higher income generally correlates with higher life expectancy**, though some countries achieve strong health outcomes on modest budgets.
- **Child mortality** has dramatically improved across the globe, especially in Asia and Latin America.
- **Sub-Saharan Africa** continues to lag in life expectancy and income, though progress is observable over time.
- **Population growth** can impact health infrastructure, with high-growth countries facing challenges in maintaining low mortality rates.
